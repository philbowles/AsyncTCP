# AsyncTCP

## Async TCP Library for ESP32 Arduino

This is a fully asynchronous TCP library much like the original, apart form the fact that it works properly.

## What's fixed

95% of the API is the same as ESPAsyncTCP (the ESP8266 version) apart from one minor problem: This lib does not pass through the TCP PSH flag, which means you can never receive more than N buffers' worth of data (where N is implementation-dependent) because you cannot tell which is the last packet in a multi-packet > buffer size set of data. Clue: It's the one with the PSH flag set. See the problem?

So, PSH flag collected on TCP recv, saved and made available to new API call (same as ESPAsyncTCP)

```cpp
bool isRecvPush(); // is the PSH flag set, i.e. is this the last packet?
```

# Issues

## If you want a *quick* resolution, please follow these rules:

1. As with all H4 and H4Plugins libraries, please make sure you have read *all* the relevant documentation relating to the issue and watched any videos on the [Youtube channel (instructional videos)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYi-Ko76_3p9hBUtleZRY6g). Please also subscribe to the channel for notifications of news and updates.

2. If you still think there is a problem, then join the [Facebook H4  Support / Discussion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/444344099599131/) group and report the issue briefly there. This is because I visit the group every day, whereas I do not have time to visit 11 github repos every day. Furthermore, it alerts other users to potential problems and allows an initial assessment. 

3. If there is a genuine issue then you will be referred to [Raising H4/H4Plugins issues](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins/blob/master/docs/issues.md) after which you are advised to create a full github issue report.

4. Failing to make an initial report in the [Facebook H4  Support / Discussion](https://www.facebook.com/groups/444344099599131/) group and simply starting with a github issue, or failing to include all of the information required in [Raising H4/H4Plugins issues](https://github.com/philbowles/h4plugins/blob/master/docs/issues.md) is likely to result in a ***long*** delay before it gets picked up.
